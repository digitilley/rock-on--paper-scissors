# **Rock (On), Paper, Scissors**

## **Introduction**

Rock (On), Paper, Scissors was created as a fun take on the traditional game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, while sticking to the same core concepts as the original. The game is a user vs computer simulation and offers the user the choice of 3 variables; Rock (On), Paper or Scissors. The script I've written randomly selects one of the 3 options on the computers behalf. The rules are simple, Rock (On) blunts Scissors, Paper covers Rock (On) and Scissors cut Paper. The user will score 1 point for every winning selection, the computer scores 1 point for every winning random selection and neither opponent scores a point if it's a tie. The winner of the game is determined by whoever reaches 15 first.
